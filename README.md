# Creating validated forms using JSON

Creating validated forms using JSON means defining forms using JSON and validating their input data. Using JSON, you can create forms with simple or complex validation.

In this method, first a JSON containing the definition of form fields and their types is created. Then, this JSON is sent to a form validation library that can perform validation and display error messages to the user.

For example, suppose you want to create a registration form with validation. You can define a JSON that includes fields such as username, password, and password confirmation. Then, you can send this JSON to a form validation library such as Yup. These libraries can perform validation and display error messages to the user.

Using this method, you can create easily validated forms with less code. Additionally, this method allows you to perform validation in a centralized location and avoid repeating code throughout your program.
