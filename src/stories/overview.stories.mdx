# Welcome to <Text text={process.env.STORYBOOK_NAME} />

** <Text text={process.env.STORYBOOK_DESC} /> **

Creating validated forms using JSON means defining forms using JSON and validating their input data. Using JSON, you can create forms with simple or complex validation.

In this method, first a JSON containing the definition of form fields and their types is created. Then, this JSON is sent to a form validation library that can perform validation and display error messages to the user.

For example, suppose you want to create a registration form with validation. You can define a JSON that includes fields such as username, password, and password confirmation. Then, you can send this JSON to a form validation library such as Yup. These libraries can perform validation and display error messages to the user.

Using this method, you can create easily validated forms with less code. Additionally, this method allows you to perform validation in a centralized location and avoid repeating code throughout your program.

# why <Text text={process.env.STORYBOOK_NAME+' ?'} />

This form generator can create forms with JSON and is implemented with the popular [formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik) and [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) libraries

### Features

- Form-level Validation
- Only Bootstrap Grid System
- Support all ui tools
- Nested form elements
- Communication between form elements

# Installation

You can install Formik with NPM, Yarn, or a good ol' `<script>` via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/).

## NPM

```javascript
npm i ccvfj-react-app
```

Or

```javascript
yarn add ccvfj-react-app
```

# The Gist

<TabContainer>
  <Tab title="React" badge="TS">
    <Preview className="my-0" mdxSource={codeFormGenerator}>
      <div className="w-100">
        <Form.Basic {...BasicArgs} />
      </div>
    </Preview>
  </Tab>
</TabContainer>

# Config

Below is a suggested method to be able to use form elements for <Text text={process.env.STORYBOOK_NAME} /> and separately, you can directly configure your form components.

This method is so that we can control and configure all the elements of the form at the same time.

<Source language="javascript" dark format={false} code={codeFormControl} />

We create a static model to relate to the properties of our form elements (optional).

<Source
  language="javascript"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={codeFormGeneratorTypes}
/>

Below is an example of the input component

<Source language="javascript" dark format={false} code={codeCustomInput} />

<p>create wrapper ui and provider form</p>
<Source language="javascript" dark format={false} code={codeFormProvider} />

And finally, we configure the form generator with form elements.

This work only needs to be done once and the suggestion is in the App.tsx file.

<Source
  language="javascript"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={"/// src/App.tsx" + "\n\n" + codeConfigForm}
/>
